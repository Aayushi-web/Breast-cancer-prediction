🩺 #Breast Cancer Prediction

Welcome to the Breast Cancer Prediction project repository! This project leverages machine learning techniques to predict breast cancer based on diagnostic data. The detailed analysis and implementation are available in the accompanying Jupyter Notebook.

📜 #Overview

Breast cancer is a common and serious health concern. Early and accurate diagnosis can significantly improve outcomes. This project explores a predictive model using machine learning techniques to assist in diagnosing breast cancer.

#Key Highlights

Comprehensive data preprocessing.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and insights.

Implementation of machine learning models.

Performance evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

📊# Dataset

The dataset used in this project is publicly available and contains diagnostic information on breast cancer. Features include:

Mean radius, texture, perimeter, area, and smoothness.

Diagnosis labels: M (malignant) and B (benign).

#Source: Kaggle Breast Cancer Dataset
